<h1>The Basics of Web Development</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. It can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
    complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>

<h2>Front-End Development</h2>
<p>Front-end development refers to the part of web development that involves creating the user interface and experience. This includes everything that users see and
    interact with on a website.</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure of a webpage.</p>

<h4>Basic HTML Elements</h4>
<p>Some of the basic HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. These elements are defined by HTML tags.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the style and layout of web pages. It allows developers to separate content from design.</p>

<h4>Styling with CSS</h4>
<p>CSS can be used to apply styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, and spacing. This helps to create visually appealing web pages.</p>

<h2>Back-End Development</h2>
<p>Back-end development involves server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, and website architecture. It is what makes the website function and allows
    users to interact with it.</p>

<h3>Server-Side Languages</h3>
<p>Common server-side languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js. These languages are used to write the logic that runs on the server.</p>

<h4>Database Management</h4>
<p>Databases are used to store and manage data. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.</p>

<h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
<p>Full-stack development refers to the development of both front-end and back-end portions of an application. A full-stack developer has skills in both front-end and
    back-end technologies.</p>

<h3>Frameworks and Libraries</h3>
<p>There are many frameworks and libraries available to help streamline web development. Some popular front-end frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js. For
    back-end, popular frameworks include Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<h4>Choosing the Right Tools</h4>
<p>Choosing the right frameworks and libraries depends on the project requirements and personal preference. It's important to stay updated with the latest trends and
    technologies in web development.</p>
